# MakePrivate
A .bat file to hide files in Windows uses the attrib command to set "hidden" and "system" attributes, making files invisible even in File Explorer. Advanced scripts may include password protection or disguise their function. Lightweight and efficient, it secures sensitive data without third-party tools.
